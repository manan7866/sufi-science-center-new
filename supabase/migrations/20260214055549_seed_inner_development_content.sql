Al-Ghazali teaches that anger has legitimate place when directed toward injustice, but must be purified of ego attachment. The practice involves recognizing anger arising, pausing before reaction, examining its source (ego vs. principle), and channeling energy appropriately.',
  'Modern psychology recognizes anger as a secondary emotion often masking hurt, fear, or unmet needs. Cognitive behavioral approaches teach the ABC model: Activating event, Beliefs, Consequences. Emotional regulation skills include: recognizing physical signs, pause-and-breathe techniques, cognitive reframing, and assertive communication.

Effective approaches include: identifying catastrophic thinking patterns, challenging cognitive distortions, gradual exposure, mindfulness of physical sensations, and building window of tolerance.
