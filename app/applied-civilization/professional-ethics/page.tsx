    body: 'Every professional ethical framework in this system is grounded in the classical Sufi moral tradition — not as rhetorical ornamentation, but as a systematic analytical structure. The core concepts: Justice (Adl), Trust (Amanah), Sincerity (Ikhlas), Balance (Tawazun), and Public Benefit (Maslaha).',

        term: 'Amanah (Trust)',
        definition: 'Every professional role is a form of delegated trust. The physician holds the trust of the patient\'s vulnerability. The judge holds the trust of those who cannot obtain justice themselves. The engineer holds the trust of the communities their structures will shelter. Trust is not a metaphor — it is a precise obligation with identifiable content.',

        term: 'Ikhlas (Sincerity)',
        definition: 'Professional sincerity is not performative. It is the alignment of visible action with invisible motivation. Ikhlas demands that the professional examine their actual motivations — not their stated ones — and correct the gap between them.',

        term: 'Tawazun (Balance)',

        term: 'Maslaha (Public Benefit)',
        definition: 'Classical Islamic jurisprudence developed Maslaha as a principle for evaluating actions by their contribution to human flourishing.

These are not incidental risks — they are structurally embedded in the work itself. Recognition is the first step; systematic calibration is the practice.',

The physician who protects reputation over patient welfare.',

        definition: 'Artificial intelligence systems are optimized for measurable proxies of desired outcomes. The proxies systematically diverge from the actual goals. The result: systems that achieve benchmark performance while producing discriminatory, harmful, or ungovernable behavior. The solution requires ethical integration at design, not post-deployment mitigation.',

The ethical framework is present in classical economics — it has been systematically removed from professional practice.',

        term: 'The Power Differential Protocol',
        definition: 'Every professional relationship involves power differentials. The ethical obligation runs downward in the hierarchy: the more power you hold, the more proactive your accountability obligations. This is not sentiment — it is the structural logic of fiduciary responsibility.',

Closed systems of spiritual transmission without external scrutiny predictably generate abuse.',

        term: 'The Abuse of Methodology',
