                  The parallel is not proof of equivalence. Scientific method operates on publicly observable
                  phenomena with intersubjective verification. Contemplative practice operates on phenomenal
                  interiority with verification through personal transformation and lineage transmission.
                  The two methodologies are distinct — but each has something to learn from the other&apos;s
                  commitment to rigor, humility, and the recognition that the most important questions
                  remain open.
